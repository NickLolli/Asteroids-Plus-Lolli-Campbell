## Description
​​The goal of this project is to recreate the popular Atari game, Asteroids. This classic arcade game has the user play as a spaceship moving around a 2D top view open space in which the user has to dodge and destroy asteroids hurdling towards them. Destroying an asteroid has the chance to drop a power up for the user such as extra life, deflector shields, and a big bomb. Along with survival mode, Asteroid Plus will include a co-op mode where you can play against a friend to see who can survive the longest! While Survival mode focuses on obtaining a high score through destroying as many ships and asteroids as possible, co-op mode limits player shooting and increases asteroid spawning. In co-op mode, the name of the game is to dodge, whose the better space pilot?!
