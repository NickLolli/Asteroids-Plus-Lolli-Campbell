## Description
​​The goal of this project is to recreate the popular Atari game, Asteroids. 
This classic arcade game has the user play as a spaceship moving around a 2D 
top view open space in which the user has to dodge and destroy asteroids hurdling towards them.
Destroying an asteroid has the chance to drop a power up for the user such as spread shots,
deflector shields, and more. There have been many modes created over the years for Asteroids, 
but for this project we will create only the survival mode. In survival, 
The player has three lives to which a life is lost after being hit by an asteroid. 
As the time of the playthrough increases, so does the difficulty, and once all three lives are 
lost, the game ends.
